		<h1> DESCRIPTION : </h1>
		<body><p>Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Located on the west coast of India, it is the countryâ€™s largest city and one of the most populous urban areas in the world, with a population of over 20 million people.

		Mumbai is a major economic, cultural, and entertainment hub. It is home to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), several multinational corporations, and the headquarters of major Indian industries. The city is also the center of the Bollywood film industry, producing more films annually than any other city in the world.<br><br>

		Known for its vibrant street life, colonial-era architecture, and a mix of modern skyscrapers alongside historic buildings, Mumbai is a city of contrasts. It features iconic landmarks such as the Gateway of India, Marine Drive, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CST), and the Elephanta Caves. The city is also famous for its diverse culture, bustling markets like Crawford Market, and its cosmopolitan atmosphere, attracting people from all over India and the world.<br><br>

		Mumbai is often described as the city of dreams, with a blend of luxury and poverty, ambition and struggle. It is an economic powerhouse and a city of opportunity, but it also faces challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, and social inequality. Despite these challenges, Mumbai remains a dynamic and resilient city with a unique energy and spirit.<br><br>
